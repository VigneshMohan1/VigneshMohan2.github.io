		    <h2>A very long time ago, certain cousins from the same family battled against each other in one of the fiercest and bloodiest wars that history has ever witnessed. The battle field of 
Kurukshetra still speaks tales about the Great War where mere mortals turned into legends throughout eternity. Now, the epic battle ground has been recreated at the College of Engineering, 
Guindy but this time around, the battle is fought with wits and intellect.
Welcome to Kurukshetra, the international techno management fest conducted by College of Engineering, Guindy!
The eighth edition of Kurukshetra is scheduled from January 29 to February 1, 2014. Kurukshetra attracts over 20000 participants from over 80 countries across the globe. Students flock from 
1200 colleges in the country and 800 colleges overseas. It also has the privilege of being the first techno management fest in India to be awarded the coveted UNESCO patronage. Kurukshetra 
provides you a chance to become a legend and leave behind your legacy that will tell tales over the years to come. Only the fittest can survive the Battle of the Brains!

<h2>
Greetings from the Student Directors of the CEG Tech Forum. It gives us immense pleasure to host the 8th edition of Kurukshetra. The CEG Tech Forum was initially started in 2006 to promote 
a technical culture among college communities. We help in realizing the dreams of every student with promising ambitions. We celebrate this technological excellence by conducting Kurukshetra,
 the international techno management fest, annually. Kurukshetra was started as a small scale event and has grown leaps and bounds in great magnitude to an international event that has 
 gained the UNESCO patronage. The aim of Kurukshetra is to provide a unique experience for all the students across the country. Over the years, we redefined technical innovation and today,
 we have created a legacy that promises much more over the years. We invite you to be a part of this phenomenon.
This year, let us celebrate technology at Kurukshetra!
The Student Directors,
CEG Tech Forum
